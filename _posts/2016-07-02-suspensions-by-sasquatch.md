  First you need to measure the sag in the same way I described in my last blog
  post.Your forks should sag between 1/4 and 1/3 the distance of your full
  suspension travel, which you will need to look at your bike's specification
  sheet to find out that number.As an example, if you have 10" of total fork
  travel, your total loaded sag should be between 2.5" and 3.3".
