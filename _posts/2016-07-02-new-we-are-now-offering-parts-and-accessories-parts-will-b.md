Here at Adventure Power Sports, LLC and Sasquatch Suspensions I want to be your one stop shop for total motorcycle and ATV repair and upgrades. We offer personal service that will exceed your expectations. Stop dealing with large dealerships who treat you like a number, come here and become a friend. I offer full service motorcycle and ATV parts and repairs as well as world class suspension services.

I created Sasquatch Suspensions to be the leader in building Adventure touring and dual sport motorcycle suspensions. When you deal with my company you will get personal service second to none. I will take the time to answer your questions and get to know you and your specific riding styles so that I can build your suspension perfect for you.   

I am one of the pioneers in rebuilding and modifying original equipment non-rebuildable shocks like those found on the popular BMW GS and Suzuki Vstrom motorcycles. Your sealed OEM shock can be completely transformed into a high performing shock that is fully rebuildable at a fraction of the cost of purchasing a replacement shock.   

So if you were told that your stock shock was a throw away item, call us before you toss it for an expensive replacement shock, we can save you a lot of money all while giving you the same performance. I use only the finest components in your suspensions and offer custom spring manufacturing. We also offer all aftermarket shocks and suspension components from Hyperpro, Race Tech, Ohlins, and YSS.

I ride what I sell. We are avid adventure touring and dual sport enthusiasts. This gives me the experience and knowledge to set up suspensions for how you ride and load your bikes. So give us a call and let us help you set up your Vstrom, GS, Triumph, KTM or virtually any other bike you may have.
