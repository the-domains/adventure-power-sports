# **Suspension Building Services**

_Sasquatch Suspension is a Race Tech certified service facility with more than 15 years suspension building experience. We service all makes and models of motorcycles with rebuilding, revalving, custom springs and aftermarket shock options. We carry Hyperpro, Wilbers, Ohlins, Race Tech, and YSS shocks and fork products to enhance your enjoyment of the ride._

Have a sealed, non-serviceable shock on your Vstrom? BMW? Triumph? Yamaha? Etc., Read this:

Sasquatch Suspensions has developed rebuilding techniques that take sealed, original equipment shocks found on many of today's adventure touring bikes and turns them into a serviceable, high performing shock at a fraction of the cost of replacement shocks.

We take your OEM shock, remove the stock valving replacing it with custom valving set up for you personally, fully rebuild the shock, and then top it off with a custom spring appropriate for your specific needs. All for less than half of the cost of an aftermarket shock. And here is the great part. Not only did you get great performance at a very fair price, your shock is now rebuildable by any competent suspension tuner using common suspension seals and bushings. No more high priced servicing down the road. You can keep your shock serviced the way it should for many thousands of miles and years to come.

Choose your bike from the menu above. This is only a short list of the bikes we service, do not hesitate to contact us.

Suspension Components:

For the do it yourselfer, we carry seals, bushings, springs, and fluids for those who want to service their own suspension. From the common, current model bikes to the antique, let us help you find the right parts.
