# Why Choose Us

Sasquatch Suspensions has been in business in the Boise area since 2007 delivering high quality suspension components from  
the industries top manufacturers as well as offering rebuilding and revalving services for all types of riders. From the Adventure  
Tourer, Dual Sport rider to the dirt rider, I have the knowledge to get your bike set up for you and your riding style so it can be the  
best it can be.  
Sasquatch Suspensions pioneered the rebuilding of non serviceable OEM shocks found on many of today's Adventure touring  
bikes like BMW, Triumph, and Suzuki. Let me take your OEM shock and turn it into a high performance shock that is custom  
sprung and set up for your needs for a fraction of the cost of an aftermarket shock. And if you want an aftermarket shock, I can help  
you with that as well.

I formed Adventure Power Sports, LLC in 2014 so that I could expand my business to include full service motorcycle and ATV parts and repairs for my local customers in addition to the world class suspension services I have been offering. If you are tired of dealing with the large dealerships and being treated like a number, come on over and get treated like a friend.
